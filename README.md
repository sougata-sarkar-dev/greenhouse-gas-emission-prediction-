Data Analysis Key Findings
The dataset containing supply chain emission factors for US industries and commodities was successfully loaded, containing 264 rows and 13 columns.
No rows were removed during the cleaning step as the "Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins" column already contained no null values.
The top 10 industries with the highest total "Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins" were identified.
A bar chart visualizing these top 10 industries was successfully generated, showing "Support Activities for Oil and Gas Operations" as having the highest emission factor sum.
A histogram visualizing the distribution of "Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins" was created, indicating that the majority of emission factors are concentrated at lower values, with a long tail towards higher values.
